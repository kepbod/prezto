Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

This Repository forked here is to integrate with [iztv][2] framework. It owns some
modifications to make it more easy and beautiful to use in the [iztv][2] framework.
It will be synchronized with the Prezto master branch to obtain the newest
features.
